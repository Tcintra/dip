## Abstract

Following the successful [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) to extend and fund the operations of the dYdX Operations Trust (DOT 2.0), the [original Trust Instrument](https://file.notion.so/f/f/baeb1306-87dc-4df3-895c-5369d6f72d2d/c99a549c-fea2-4a3d-9cf0-78676282f296/Redacted_DOT_-_Trust_Agreement.pdf?id=c0fd1922-a298-4dc3-90e6-3a540c1d48bb&table=block&spaceId=baeb1306-87dc-4df3-895c-5369d6f72d2d&expirationTimestamp=1697688000000&signature=H7O-QR1MX1IMSjQCQTvlliOBoC6mB-3_tCMD2P95SQc) was [amended](https://file.notion.so/f/f/baeb1306-87dc-4df3-895c-5369d6f72d2d/ccccf180-bd81-490c-8549-6cbab26eea08/Redacted_Trust_Amendment_-_Law_Provision.pdf?id=ed1c2290-5206-4daf-9f2b-9ff4912b75c0&table=block&spaceId=baeb1306-87dc-4df3-895c-5369d6f72d2d&expirationTimestamp=1697623200000&signature=jlfJ1mPJqmg0RF3I-6lXc48N4bH6c30o3VfFaFkaSOs) to reflect the [DOT 2.0 mandate](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/13) approved through dYdX governance by the dYdX community. 

Furthermore, after discussing with legal counsel it was recommended to add a clause that requires all Trustees to operate in compliance with all laws, regulations, and rules applicable to their duties under the Trust Instrument.

The dYdX community has approved this proposal via a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x46c40ddea980c824fd7787f9b73b6b1a842162dee8d155ad08a4d90a93dd333e) with 12M DYDX (99.5% of total votes) in favor of the proposal and 5.5k DYDX against the proposal.


## Motivation

DOT 2.0 is a significant evolution from DOT 1.0 as described in the DOT 2.0 [mandate](https://dydx.forum/t/drc-amendments-to-the-dydx-operations-trust-instrument/1054) and therefore, an amendment to the original Trust Instrument was required.

Separately, we have included a provision that requires all Trustees to operate in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to their duties under the Trust. This was not clearly stated in the previous version of the Trust Instrument.

## Specification

We are proposing the following changes to the Trust Instrument - these changes have been drafted in coordination with our legal counsel.

The original Purposes section “Schedule 3” is drafted as follows:

*PURPOSES*

“*The Purposes of the Settlement are to:

1. receive funds from the dYdX Community, including Ethereum based tokens, and retain the same unless and until they are required to be converted to cash or equivalents and/or distributed for the remaining Purposes of this Settlement;

2. apply funds received from the dYdX Community to meet the ongoing operational costs and expenses, including (without limitation):
(a) fees for professional services, such as lawyer and accountancy fees; and 
(b) costs for online service providers;

3. manage administrative processes to support the Purposes listed at paragraphs 1 and 2 of this schedule 3, including (without limitation), opening and managing any one or more bank accounts in the names of the Trustees; and

4. do all other acts and things that may be incidental to, or desirable, to further the above Purposes as the Trustees may in their discretion think fit.*”

We propose to replace it with this new version:

*PURPOSES*

“*The Purposes of the Settlement are to:

1. receive funds from the dYdX Community, including Ethereum based tokens, and
retain the same unless and until they are required to be converted to cash or
equivalents and/or distributed for the remaining Purposes of this Settlement;

2. deploy and operate the following for the mainnet deployment of the dYdX V4
open-source software (the dYdX Chain):

(a) a website user interface;
(b) an Android application; and
(c) an IOS application;

3. identify and contract:

(a) an indexer operator for the dYdX Chain;
(b) a user support team to support the dYdX Community with any issues or
enquiries related to the dYdX Chain;

4. apply funds received from the dYdX Community to meet ongoing operational
costs and expenses, including (without limitation):
(a) fees for professional services, such as lawyer and accountancy fees; and
(b) costs for online service providers;

5. manage administrative processes to support the Purposes listed above, including
(without limitation), opening and managing any one or more bank accounts in the
names of the Trustees; and

6. do all other acts and things that may be incidental to, or desirable, to further the
above Purposes as the Trustees may in their discretion think fit.*”

In addition to the above-mentioned change we also propose a further amendment to the Trust Instrument, stating the Trustee’s duty to act lawfully at all times explicitly. This was only implied in the original Trust Instrument. This clarification avoids any possible doubt on the necessity of the Trustees to abide by the applicable law when acting as Trustees. The proposed change is to:

Replace the current section 9.1:

"*9.1 The Trustees shall exercise or refrain from exercising the powers and discretions vested in them as they shall in their absolute discretion think most expedient for the attainment of the Purposes.*”

With:

“*9.1 The Trustees shall execute and administer this Settlement and shall exercise their functions under it:

(a) in accordance with the provisions of the Proper Law of this Settlement and any
other law applicable to the Trustees or the Settlement (as the case may be) from
time to time, and in particular, each Trustee undertakes to:

(i) operate in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to
their duties and obligations under this Settlement; and

(ii) maintain or cause to be maintained in force all licenses, permits, consents,
authorisations and approvals required by any law, rule or regulation for the
performance of their duties under this Settlement, including, in each case,
with respect to any acts taken in the advancement of the Purposes (which
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the formation, deployment,
operation or administration of any user interface in furtherance of the
Purposes); and

(b) subject to the provisions of the Proper Law of this Settlement –
(i) in accordance with the terms of this Settlement; and
(ii) only for the advancement of the Purposes.*”
