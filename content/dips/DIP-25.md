## Simple Summary

Extend the dYdX Grants Program v1.5 for six months using the existing budget on hand. As part of the extension, replace four of the five Trustees and the Enforcer of the dYdX Grants Trust.

## Abstract

Reverie is proposing to extend the current version of the dYdX Grants Program (v1.5) for an additional six months.
The extension will leverage the knowledge and experience from the previous rounds to continue funding high impact projects that drive protocol growth throughout the transition to dYdX v4.
To improve the management and efficiency of the program, the organizational structure will be updated to include more contributors. The concept of _funding buckets_ is introduced to split grants between Community Initiatives and Strategic Initiatives, with different Grantors responsible for each bucket. Additionally, an Operator role is added to manage the financial activity and reporting of the program.
The extension also includes updating the dYdX Grants Trust with four new Trustees and a new Enforcer. The updates to the Trust ensure proactive engagement on behalf of Trust contributors.

The snapshot vote concluded with 381 voters and 60M DYDX in agreement (100%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.

## Motivation

Following on the success of the dYdX Grants Program v1.5, the goal is to continue funding grants that drive value and impact to the dYdX protocol, with specific focus on benefiting the transition to dYdX v4.
The program will focus funding efforts on protocol infrastructure (to support the new dYdX v4 protocol), MEV research and mitigation (to protect users from harmful MEV on v4), staking tools and resources (to support a smooth introduction of validators and staking activity), and additional targets on community growth.

The program will be restructure to include two funding categories:
- Community initiatives: grants that impact community growth and ecosystem development
- Strategic initiatives: grants that impact the protocol and infrastructure development

The introduction of two distinct funding categories, led by different Grantor teams, hopes to improve the grant selection process and its efficiency. Grantors will specialize in their initiatives to deliver the most impact to dYdX.
The addition of a separate Operator role will also improve the overall controls and operational efficiency of the program.
Replacing four of the existing Trustees with new contributors that have more relevant knowledge and experience of both the dYdX and Cosmos ecosystems will improve the Grant approval process. Given that Reverie will transition to a Grantor role, appointing a new Enforcer will also improve the integrity of the dYdX Grants Trust.

## Specification

**Program Design**

* $2M funding in DYDX
* 6 months period
* Reverie leading Strategic Initiatives
* RoboMcGobo and an additional grantor leading Community Initiatives
* Lemma Solutions as Operator
* 5 Trustees
* 1 Enforcer

**Budget**

The existing [budget](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFa3811E5C92358133330f9F787980ba1e8E0D99a) of ~$2M will be used for the next six months. The program will naturally expire if the budget is depleted ahead of the six month period.
The program will diversify up to 75% of the DYDX on hand to USDC to further secure the operational runway and ensure adequate funding for U.S. based grantees.

$336,000 of the budget will be allocated to compensation for contributors and operational expenses for the program.

**Contributors**

Reverie Reserves, LLC will be appointed to run the Strategic Initiatives bucket.
RoboMcGobo along with an additional contributor will be appointed to run the Community Initiatives bucket. The new Trustees will run a separate selection process for the additional grantor.
Lemma Solutions will be appointed to serve the Operator role.

**dYdX Grants Trust Changes**

The following changes will be conducted on the dYdX Grants Trust:

## Rationale

The community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a v1.5 of the Grants program in the DRC, but overall consensus has been in strong support of launching. The program will work to improve the success of the dYdX v4 transition while growing both the user base and community through ecosystem initiatives.
