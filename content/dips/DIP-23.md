## Simple Summary

Important Notice: This proposal is being sponsored by Wintermute Governance’s DYDX proposal/voting power on behalf of the dYdX Operations Trust.

On behalf of the dYdX Operations Trust (“DOT”), Trustees Joanna and Callen are requesting $6.6M of funding from the [dYdX community treasury](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/community-treasury) to be transferred to the DOT’s [multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8541f948411b3F95d9e89e8D339a56A9ed3D00b) to fund operations of the Operations subDAO for an additional 18-month term (“DOT 2.0”).

## Abstract

The dYdX Operations SubDAO is creating this DIP on behalf of the DOT to request $6.6M in funding for the next 18 months.

From our perspective, it is critical for the dYdX DAO, and specifically the OPS subDAO, to take steps before the potential launch of dYdX V4 on mainnet to ensure that the dYdX DAO has the resources, tools, and infrastructure it needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol. 

The funding request will cover the operations and administrative needs of the dYdX Operations subDAO as described in the proposal for 18 months.

The DOT currently has $87,077.50 USDC remaining. After the expiration of the DOT 1.0 term on June 19, 2023, we are proposing to roll over any remaining budget to DOT 2.0.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) concluded with 303 voters and 17.7M DYDX in agreement (99.95%). The vote results have shown significant support for the next phase of DOT.

[Forum Discussion](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274)

## Motivation

On 15 May 2023, the dYdX Foundation posted, [“Exploring the dYdX Operations subDAO’s near future”](https://dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-dydx-operations-subdaos-near-future). We agree that the dYdX ecosystem is approaching a critical juncture with the potential launch of dYdX V4 mainnet and the initial 6-month term of the DOT expiring on June 19, 2023. 

To ensure that the dYdX DAO has the resources, tools, and infrastructure it needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol DOT 2.0 will be responsible for:

Recruiting an [Operations Lead](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/2C4716A228/), a [Technical Project Lead](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/A62FE0DD9F/), and a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://apply.workable.com/dydx-operations-trust/j/D5F3924650/) to scale the Ops subDAO and to provide technical support to prepare the dYdX DAO for the future.
Identifying an indexer operator and contribute to deploying an indexer in the potential future version of the dYdX protocol.
Contribute to deploying open-source software and the running of a version of the iOS app, Android app, and website (browser) front-ends for the potential future version of the dYdX protocol.
Engage a third-party auditor to assess DOT’s finances and performance, as well as increase the number of trustees on DOT’s multisig.
The remaining funds at the end of the DOT 2.0 mandate will be sent to a community-controlled wallet at the discretion of the dYdX community.

For a full breakdown of the proposal’s mandate please see the [forum post](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274).

## Specification

Most of this budget is expected to be converted to USDC and/or fiat USD, and the remainder will be reserved for native token compensation.

**DYDX Amount:**
The amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the Ops Trust Multisig will be determined using a 24h VWAP of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. The following data file is used:

https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/trades/DYDXUSDT/DYDXUSDT-trades-2023-06-12.zip

This formula will be used to calculate the price: Σ(Price * Volume) / Σ(Volume).

From the data, we calculate the 24h VWAP price to be: $9,014,897 / $5,881,461  = $1.53


The DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $6,600,000 / $1.53 = 4,314,000 DYDX (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).


### Trustees:
Reverie Reserves, LLC, and George Beall have decided that they will no longer be involved in the DOT as a trustee and the enforcer, respectively, after the expiration of the current term on June 19, 2023. We also recognize that as funding increases, adding additional security measures becomes increasingly important. As such, we have decided to increase the number of trustees to 5 and upgrade the multi-sig to 3-of-5 from a 2-of-3.

If this on-chain vote is passed, the dYdX Operations Trust by the consent of the dYdX community will be amended to reflect the new Trustees and Enforcer listed below:

Trustees:
* Joanna Pope Consulting Pty Ltd
* Callen Van Den Elst
* Chaos Labs, Ltd
* Flipside Cayman, Ltd
* Christoph Sonn

Enforcer:
* Joseph Axisa

Note: Francis Gowen (Fig) will join the Trust as Flipside Cayman, Ltd, and Joanna Pope will join the Trust as Joanna Pope Consulting Pty Ltd. This is slightly different to the structure outlined in the [forum post](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274/23) 


## Rationale

The outlined budget and subsequent mandate have been designed to address the critical needs of the DAO moving into the potential launch of V4. Specifically addressing items that are critical to providing the resources, tools, and infrastructure the DAO needs to lead a fully decentralized version of the dYdX protocol.

Given the large funding request, we have decided to increase the multi-sig to a 3-of-5 from a 2-of-3. This will improve security and bring greater peace of mind and transparency to the community.

Overall, the community has been very supportive of this proposal indicated in both the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x51659bfec4948e80c0b85316d3098e62ab085a95033f1c0fe6bcc72db3ebe814) and [forum discussion](https://dydx.forum/t/dydx-operations-subdao-v2/274)
